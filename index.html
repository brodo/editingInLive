  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Hi, I'm Julian from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siegen">Siegen</a>, Germany.

  <em>Clips</em>, which are also called <em>regions</em> is a reference in Live to an audio file on the hard drive.
  You can create one by dragging and audio file form the file browser on the left to the arrangement view
  on the right:

  Per default, the clip will contain the contents of the whole audio file. You can <em>trim</em> the clip

  to the edge of a clip and then dragging it to the left or right.

  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  I choose to make a website with small videos for this lesson because I felt this kind of content is
  easier to follow in video form than with screenshots. I did not make one long video, because this
  format gives it more structure and can be used like a reference.
